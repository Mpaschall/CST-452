# CST-452
DungeonRunner Game

This is my project for CST-452 with Professor Lauren VanTalia. In this project, I will create an ARPG game that will allow players to fight monsters and gain loot. In the current state, players can regenerate health and mana and attack an npc character using animations and particle effects. In future iterations, I will implement the inventory system, update map features, update the action bar, and allow the AI to move and attack the player.
